Visualizations Showing Infant Mortality vs. GDP per Capita Globally

Using data sets from Kaggle, I created a series of visualizations to show how infant mortality varies from country to country.  

An initial low-fidelity scatter plot shows a strong skew toward nations with low GDP per Capita. This is not surprising. Comparing wealthy nations with poor nations was not likely to give meaningful results.  

I settled on GDP per capita as a measure of comparing countries, and I derived this feature from the GDP and Population features in the original data sets. I then ranked the countries into quartiles based on GDP per Capita.  

Group 1 - Lowest GDP per Capita  
Group 2 - Low Mid GDP per Capita  
Group 3 - High Mid GDP per Capita  
Group 4 - Highest GDP per Capita  

Subsequent analysis compared countries within these groups. For instance, one can determine which wealthy nations have the highest rates of Infant Mortality when compared with other coutries in the same group. This might indicate that the healthcare systems in these countries face challenges despite the availability of resources. One can also gain insights as to which continents struggle the most with Infant Mortality.  

An Excel file lists all of the visualizations and their descriptions. All graphs are interactive and designed to be clear and easy to use.  

An HTML copy of the Jupyter Notebook shows how the data sets were processed to create the visualizations.  

I did not include the original data sets, but a second Excel file provides a summary of key features as well as information as to how the data set was divided into quartiles.
